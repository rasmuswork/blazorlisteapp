Database practice project, made to work on mac.

A project that was made to show if a given day was a holiday or not in Denmark. Developed on Mac and then ported to Windows and back, I had to rework the project again to work with Mac after making it work on Windows.
Originally was supposed to take very little time but ended up being very difficult to fix.
